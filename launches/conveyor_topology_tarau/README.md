This conveyor network was adapted from the work [Tarau, Alina N., Bart De Schutter, and Hans Hellendoorn. "Model-based control for route choice in automated baggage handling systems." IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews) 40.3 (2010): 341-351]. To match our requirements on conveyor graphs, some nodes were split into junctions and diverters. In addition, the edges of the original graph were assigned to conveyors (multiple such assignments are possible, and some of the simpler assignments was selected).
